## Description

In this repository, you will find a step-by-step guide on how to create a Flask application using Python and connect it to a MySQL database, with each component running in a separate container. I have documented the entire process in detail, including how to set up the containers and link them together using a Docker Compose file.

## Flask Application

This Flask application is a simple to-do list that allows users to input and remove tasks, with each task being stored and saved in a MySQL database. The code for the flask application can be found **"add specific location here"**
